        <P>Islam is the second largest religion in South Asia with about 600 million Muslims, forming about one third of
            South Asia's population. South Asia has the largest population of Muslims in the world, with about one-third
            of
            all Muslims being from South Asia.[17][18][19] Islam is the dominant religion in half of the South Asian
            countries (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Maldives and Pakistan). In India, Islam is the second-largest religion
            while
            in Sri Lanka and Nepal it is the third-largest religion.

            <STROng>HABIBUR RAHMAN HABIB</STROng> Islam existed in South Asian communities along the Arab coastal trade
            routes in Sindh, Gujarat, Malabar, and Ceylon. As soon as the religion originated and had gained early
            acceptance in the Arabian Peninsula, though the first incursion through sea by the new Muslim successor
            states
            of the Arab World occurred around 636 CE or 643 AD, during the Rashidun Caliphate, long before any Arab army
            reached the frontier of India by land. The Barwada Mosque in Ghogha, Gujarat built before 623 CE, Cheraman
            Juma
            Mosque (629 CE) in Methala, Kerala and Palaiya Jumma Palli (630 CE) in Kilakarai, Tamil Nadu are three of
            the
            first mosques in South Asia which were built by seafaring Arab merchants.[20][21][22][23][24] The connection
            between the Sind and Islam was established by the initial Muslim missions during the Rashidun Caliphate.
            Al-Hakim ibn Jabalah al-Abdi, who attacked Makran in the year 649 AD, was an early partisan of Ali ibn Abu
            Talib. During the caliphate of Ali, many Hindu Jats of Sindh had came under influence of Shi'ism and some
            even
            participated in the Battle of Camel and died fighting for Ali.[25] Under the Umayyads (661 â€“ 750 AD), many
            Shias
            sought asylum in the region of Sindh, to live in relative peace in the remote area. After the Islamic
            conquest
            of Persia was completed, the Muslim Arabs then began to move towards the lands east of Persia and in 652
            captured Herat.[26] In 712 CE, a young Arab general Muhammad bin Qasim conquered most of the Indus region
            for
            the Umayyad empire, to be made the "As-Sindh" province with its capital at Al-
